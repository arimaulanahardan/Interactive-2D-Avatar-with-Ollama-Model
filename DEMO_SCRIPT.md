**State**: Avatar at rest, neutral expression
**Highlight**: Show status display = "Idle, Neutral"

### Scene 3: Happy Interaction (10 seconds)

### Scene 7: Conclusion (3 seconds)
**Visual**: Zoom out to show full interface
**Text Overlay Options**:
- "Text-only, no audio required"
- "Prototype complete ✓"

## Key Points to Demonstrate

### MUST Show
1. ✅ Mouth animation (open/close toggle)
2. ✅ Expression changes (neutral, happy, angry)
3. ✅ Smooth crossfade transitions
4. ✅ Speaking state indicators
5. ✅ Expression persists after speaking

### AVOID
- Don't rush through animations
- Don't skip neutral → happy → angry sequence
- Don't cut off animations mid-cycle

## Alternative: Silent with Text Overlays

If doing voiceless recording, add text overlays:

**Overlay 1**: "Avatar responds to text only"
**Overlay 2**: "Expression: Happy"
**Overlay 3**: "Mouth animates while speaking"
**Overlay 4**: "Expression: Angry"
**Overlay 5**: "No audio input required"

## Post-Production Checklist

- [ ] Trim dead space at start/end
- [ ] Add title card if needed
- [ ] Verify all three expressions are shown
- [ ] Verify mouth animation is visible
- [ ] Export at 1080p or higher

## Notes

- **Timing**: Each response takes 1-3 seconds to "speak"
- **Speed**: Normal playback is fine (no need to speed up)
- **Audio**: Can be silent or add explanation voiceover
- **Length**: Aim for under 60 seconds total

## Quick Recording Option

**Fastest Demo** (20 seconds):
1. Start recording
2. Show avatar neutral (2s)
3. Click "Test Happy" → wait for animation (5s)
4. Click "Test Angry" → wait for animation (5s)
5. Click "Test Neutral" → wait for animation (5s)
6. Stop recording

Done! You've captured all required features.
